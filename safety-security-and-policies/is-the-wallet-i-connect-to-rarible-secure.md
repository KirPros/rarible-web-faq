Short answer: yes, but only as long as you don’t do something to compromise it.

Most of the time bad actors won’t try to hack your wallet per se (because it’s pretty much impossible to brute force it), but will look for other ways to access it: for instance, DM you from a fake support account and ask you for the 12-word seed phrase. **NEVER** give that phrase to anyone. Ideally, write it down on a piece of paper so it stays completely offline.

Here’s a basic set of rules that you should stick to, but do remember that you’re the only person responsible for your security where it comes to the Web3 space:

1. Never share private keys or wallet passwords.
2. Store your private keys using a verified digital vault so that your information is safe at the same time as it is easily accessible to you.
3. Unfortunately, there are lots of malicious websites out there. Be sure that you recognize the transaction you are signing and never connect your wallet to the websites/apps you don’t trust.
