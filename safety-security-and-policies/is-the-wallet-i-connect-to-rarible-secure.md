Just like your physical wallet, your crypto wallet is secure as long as you don’t compromise it.

When you connect your wallet to Rarible, you only give us permission to “view the addresses of your permitted accounts”, meaning we can’t take anything out of your wallet.

Any transaction that costs you anything will be a separate pop-up you have to confirm each time.

So you’re safe when you’re on Rarible — but what about other pages? Follow these guidelines:

Crypto wallets are almost impossible to hack. Most of the “hacks” you hear about are actually mistakes: The owner interacted with a malicious site or gave a scammer access to their wallet.

Sometimes, bad actors DM you from a fake support account and ask you for the 12-word seed phrase. **NEVER** give that phrase to anyone. Ideally, write it down on paper so it stays completely offline.

Here we are on the frontier of technology, telling you to write things down on paper. But only you can keep your wallet safe—so here’s a few guidelines on how you can make sure you don’t get scammed:

1. Never share your private keys, seed phrase or wallet passwords.
2. Store your private keys using a verified digital vault so that your information is safe and easily accessible to you.
3. Verify every transaction you sign and only connect your wallet to websites/apps you trust.
