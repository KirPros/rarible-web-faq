We process each verification request one by one, which means that we have a specific reason for rejecting each applicant. Please check the entirety of your email notification to learn about why we were forced to deny your verification.

Each denial email, however, comes with a special link that allows you to edit your application to resubmit. Include as any and all details that can prove you are responsible for the NFTs you want to mint. Helpful information includes:

- Active social media links that display your digital artwork
- Work-in-progress images, taken prior to the completion of your NFT
- A biography

Once youâ€™re ready to resubmit, hit _Save Edits_.
