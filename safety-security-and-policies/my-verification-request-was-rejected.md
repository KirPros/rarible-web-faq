If you’re on Rarible, you’re obviously an awesome, real human being. If you got rejected, you probably just forgot something in your application.

So if you were rejected, you can reapply!

That said, there are a few reasons why we reject verification requests. If you’re missing one of the requirements, you can’t get the checkmark.

If we wrongfully rejected you (or you forgot something), find the special link in your email that lets you edit your application and resubmit.

The most important requirements for verification are:

- Active social media links that display your digital artwork
- Work-in-progress images, taken prior to the completion of your NFT
- A biography

Once you’re ready to resubmit, hit _Save Edits_—And we’re sure you’ll have that badge in no time.
