Whatâ€™s better than an NFT? 2 NFTs! But you don't always want to mint 2 NFTs of the same artwork. Unfortunately, it can happen by accident.

For instance, if you take a break between sessions and allow your browser to time out at the wrong moment, you might mint duplicates.Another way to get duplicates is to submit another NFT while your first one is still in the queue.

The best way to prevent double minting is to be patient while your transaction is pending and wait for it to confirm before doing anything else.

The good news: if your transaction is still pending, you may be able to use [this link](https://cancel-ethereum-transactions.web.app/) to cancel it.
