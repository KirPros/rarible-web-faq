If you’re confident you qualify for $RARI but didn’t receive any in the weekly drop, please file a request with our support team [here](https://rariblecom.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

When you are submitting your request, be sure to:

1. Select, "I should have received $RARI but did not,” from the dropdown options given under “What do you need help with?”
2. Copy and paste your numeric wallet address as it appears on your Rarible profile.
3. Provide as much detail in the description box as possible, including the number of tokens you feel you are entitled to. The amount of $RARI you are entitled to is based on how many NFTs you’ve sold and the value of each item sold, as well as how many NFTs you’ve purchased on Rarible and the value of each item purchased.

NOTE: $RARI is distributed on a weekly basis, so please be specific about the timing related to your activity!
