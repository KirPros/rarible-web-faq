If you can no longer see your NFT on Rarible, you may have received the following message: "This item has been removed from public access." This means your artwork or your entire account has been blocked and/or blacklisted.

Blocking and blacklist is an unfortunate result of violating the copyright laws and regulations that Rarible is required to follow. Those rules include immediately removing suspected infringement, fraud, money laundering, or any other behavior that violates international laws or our personal terms of service.

Removing any immediate requests from Rarible is the best way to protect all users. Once we remove the NFT or profile, we review each copyright dispute and legal issue one by one â€” even if you just purchased an NFT that was later blacklisted or banned.
