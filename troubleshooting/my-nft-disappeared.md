NFTs are decentralized and stored on the blockchain forever — so you might be surprised to see an NFT vanish from Rarible.

Don’t worry, Rarible can’t take anything out of your wallet or remove NFTs from any blockchain. So whatever NFTs you bought, you still own.

But they might be hidden on Rarible. Because what we can do is delist collections, items and accounts that violate community guidelines, copyright laws or other regulations.

If you can no longer see your NFT on Rarible, you may have received the following message: "This item has been removed from public access." This means your artwork or your entire account has been blocked and/or blacklisted.

This happens when a digital asset violates copyright laws, regulations or community guidelines which Rarible abides by. We immediately remove suspected copyright infringement, fraud, money laundering, or any other behavior that violates (inter-)national laws or our [terms of service](https://static.rarible.com/terms.pdf).

Removing these malicious items from access is the best way to keep Rarible awesome for everyone. Once we remove an NFT or profile, we review each copyright dispute and legal issue one by one — even if you just purchased an NFT that was later blacklisted or banned.
