# I can’t see the artwork on my NFT’s Rarible listing, what’s wrong? 

Blockchain technology is still pretty new, so not everything always works perfectly. If you can’t see the artwork associated with your NFT, you can usually fix it with two clicks: 

1. Click the three dots to the right of the NFT’s title
2. Click “refresh metadata”

After waiting a few minutes, the artwork should appear. If it doesn’t, please contact our support.
