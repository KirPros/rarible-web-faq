Your first NFT sale might become a life-changing memory, so we’re happy you want us to be part of it!

Once you mint your NFT on Rarible, you can press “sell”. Then you have three options:

1. Fixed price: Put your NFT on the market at a price anyone can buy it at.
2. Timed auction: Your NFT will be sold to the highest bidder. You can set exact starting and ending times as well as a minimum price so you don’t give your NFT away for too cheap. To get you the highest possible price, we extend your auction by 10 minutes if a bid comes in in the last 10 minutes.
3. Open auction: This shows your NFT as “open for bids”. Anyone can make you an offer at any time—and you can decline or accept any offers you get.
