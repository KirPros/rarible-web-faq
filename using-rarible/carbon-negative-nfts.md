Unfortunately, many blockchains consume a lot of energy—especially proof-of-work ones, including Ethereum. If we could, we’d wave a magic wand to fix that problem. Unfortunately, we can’t.

But we’ve found the two closest things to it:

- We’re a multi-chain NFT marketplace and integrated the Flow and Tezos blockchains—both of which use “proof of stake” mechanisms to drastically reduce their energy consumption (for context, Ethereum expects a 99,95% reduction in energy consumption from their transition to proof-of-stake in the next year)
- Our partnership with [Nori](https://nori.com/) will soon let you push a “magic button” to pay for carbon removal on NFTs sold or created on Rarible so that you can buy, mint and trade digital assets with a clear conscience!
