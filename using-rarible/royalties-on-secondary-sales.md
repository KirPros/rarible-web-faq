Yes! Weâ€™re not forcing you to get secondary royalties, but earning off of every resale is a sweet deal for artists! As a creator, you can choose your royalties when you mint your NFT. After that, you get a percentage of the sale price (usually 5-10%) deposited into your wallet every time your NFT sells.

Waking up to new assets in your wallet is a nice feeling!
