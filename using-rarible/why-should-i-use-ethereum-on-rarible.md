Ethereum is by far the most popular blockchain for NFTs. It has the biggest community and hosts the most NFTs of any blockchain. Most of the record-setting NFT sales you hear about happen on Ethereum.

So where’s the catch? Unfortunately, there is one.

Ethereum’s popularity has its downsides: Because the network is used so much and is currently based on a proof-of-work model, Ethereum’s “gas fees” are notoriously high — minting an NFT will cost you at least $60 in ETH (on a good day).

As a proof-of-work blockchain, Ethereum also consumes much more energy than proof-of-stake chains, which leads to a higher carbon footprint (although Ethereum plans to lower its energy consumption by 99,95% with its switch to proof-of-stake; the release is currently scheduled for mid 2022).

So: If you have the budget, Ethereum NFTs give you access to the biggest crowd.
