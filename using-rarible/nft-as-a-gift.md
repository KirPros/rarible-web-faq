Want to make your friend, partner or family smile with an NFT gift? Awesome!

You can transfer any NFT you own to any wallet on the same blockchain by clicking "Transfer" on its page. But on Ethereum, you can do something even better: We support NFT gifts!

If you use our gifting feature, your NFT won't just show up in someone else's wallet. Instead, you'll get a unique link to share with your loved one. There, they can "unbox" their NFT and add it to their wallet. 

Here's how it works: 

1. Navigate to an Ethereum NFT you own. 
2. Click the three dots and select "Gift this NFT". 
3. You'll be directed to Linkdrop, our partner for NFT gifts. 
4. Connect your wallet and follow the instructions on Linkdrop. 
5. You'll get a unique link to gift your NFT. Make sure you only share this with the recipient. 
6. Share the link with your loved one (and only your loved one, as anyone can claim the NFT from this link). 
7. Watch out for their excited reaction.
