As a proof-of-stake blockchain, Tezos has low fees, high performance and a smaller carbon footprint than proof-of-work blockchains.

This has attracted a vibrant scene of diverse NFT artists, collectors and creators to the community. Minting fees vary, but shouldn’t cost you more than $0.50 (though you might have to create your own collection for $3-5 first).

Like physical art prints, Tezos NFTs are often series. Artists issue the same artwork multiple times, often at a lower price than their 1/1 pieces. This makes Tezos an entry point for artists whose works don’t fetch millions (yet) — and for collectors who can’t spend millions (yet). You don’t have to serialize your art on Tezos, but it’s a popular option.
