Of course. You’re entitled to have as many skeletons (or apes) in your closet as you want.

Go to your profile, see the NFT you’d like to hide and click on the ellipsis [...] at the right upper corner of its card. Then select ‘Hide from owned’.

Voila! That NFT is now displayed under the ‘Hidden’ tap which is only visible to you. You can publish it again whenever you want.

Important to know: Hiding an NFT on Rarible only hides it on Rarible — a block explorer or other marketplace will still show the NFT.
