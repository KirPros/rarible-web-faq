Basically, it’s ownership data for each NFT. These circles are easy to read once you get the hang of it!

When you hover over those circles, you’ll find out about three different kinds of information.

The first circle represents the NFT’s collection. If it was minted on our smart contract, you’ll see a purple widget with an “R” and titled “Rarible Singles”. If the NFT is part of an artist’s separate collection, the circle will show a custom picture instead of the default “R” monogram.

That’s as complicated as it gets, so hang in there! The second circle shows you who owns the NFT with their profile picture, while the third circle shows you who minted it in the first place (usually the artist).
