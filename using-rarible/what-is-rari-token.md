$RARI token is the native governance token of the [Rarible Protocol](https://rarible.org/) – an open-source cross-chain protocol, governed by the community. The role of the $RARI token is to empower protocol users with decision making rights, allowing holders to participate in the protocol’s governance by submitting proposals and voting.

Initially distributed exclusively among active buyers and sellers on Rarible.com, $RARI has since evolved to fuel the Rarible Protocol DAO, and fund apps built on top of the protocol via Community Mining, which amounts to 60% of the total token supply.

Currently, 75,000 $RARI are distributed by the Rarible Protocol every week in the following proportions as part of Community Mining:

- 55% (41k $RARI) to the apps built on the Rarible Protocol DAO (including Rarible.com), with rewards proportional to the square root of sales volumes (learn more [here](https://medium.com/rarible-dao/awarding-nft-apps-34k-rari-750k-weekly-via-protocol-app-mining-program-df3af4856331))
- 45% (34k $RARI) distributed to the DAO treasury

As Rarible.com marketplace is built on top of the Rarible Protocol, it receives a weekly portion of $RARI token and distributes them to its users based on the sales volume.

All that said, if you make a sale or a purchase on Rarible.com, you will receive $RARI tokens the following week. The exact number of tokens you will receive will depend on the Rarible Protocol ecosystem total trading volume that week and trading volume on Rarible.com in particular.
