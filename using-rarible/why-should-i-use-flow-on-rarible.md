The Flow blockchain is tailor-made for digital collectibles. That’s why it’s super efficient for NFTs: Minting only costs a fraction of a cent (and Rarible pays it for you) — so it’s effectively free to get started!

As a proof-of-stake blockchain, Flow also has a much lower energy consumption than proof-of-work blockchains like Ethereum, which significantly lowers its carbon footprint.

This efficiency and sustainability has been attracting major sports, gaming and media brands to develop their NFT projects on Flow.

If you want to reach fans of digital sports collectibles, Flow might be your best option!
