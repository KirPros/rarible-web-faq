You’re ready to turn your creations into NFTs? Amazing! When you first create an NFT, you “mint” it with a few clicks—which might mean you have to pay a fee to the network (none of this goes to Rarible).

Fees depend on the blockchain and minting option. Blockchains charge a fee for minting, buying and selling. Imagine it like highways on a road trip. Some are free. Others charge you a toll, which can be cheap or expensive.

Creating a new NFT requires two interactions:

1. Minting your NFT
2. Making your NFT available for sale

As one of the most popular blockchains, Ethereum tends to have higher fees while the Flow blockchain is cheaper to mint on. But don’t let fees be the factor—the most important factor is minting where your audience has their wallets. Those are unique for each chain.

Or you could mint for free instead! Some of the wizards (okay, coders) on our team figured out how you can mint without paying for it.

If you enable “free minting”, the buyer of your NFT covers the fees. Keep in mind that fees might surprise fans who are trying to buy your creations. Free minting also adds your creation to the Rarible collection (collections are like folders for NFTs), not your own. To launch your own collection, you have to cover fees.
