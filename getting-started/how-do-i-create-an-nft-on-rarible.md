Turning your creations into NFTs on Rarible takes less than 5 minutes (my record is 2:47, see if you can beat it 😉 don’t rush if you’re not sure what you’re doing though!).

Click _Create_ in the top right corner of the Rarible homepage to get started. We delist all stolen art, so listing art you don’t own only leaves you paying gas and making nothing.

Enough of the disclaimers — you’re here to mint some NFTs, aren’t you?

Configure the details of your future NFT:

1. Choose whether your NFT will be a single edition or multiple edition. Select _Single_ to create a one of a kind or _Multiple_ to create a series of the same work.

2. Upload your file. It can be a PNG, GIF, WEBP, MP4 or MP3. Keep it under 100 mb size.

3. Choose a collection for your NFTs. The collection is like a folder for your NFTs – you can choose the default RARI collection (Rarible Singles) or create your own to make it easier for fans to find your work.

4. Give your art an attention-grabbing title and a compelling description so people can’t resist buying it!

5. Choose the sale type – fixed price, open auction or timed auction.

6. Select the royalties you want to receive from every secondary sale (you receive these fees based on the total sale price each time your NFT sells).

7. Add Unlockable content like secret links, vector files or other things (that’s optional).

8. Enable Free Minting to skip gas fees (if you want to).

Click “Create item”, sign the transactions with your wallet, and your art is now listed on Rarible!
