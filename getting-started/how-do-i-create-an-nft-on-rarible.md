Remember that any digital artwork can be an NFT as long as it’s unique and you are the creator. Use your platform of choice to create that artwork — whether it be [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/).

In order to transform your work into an NFT means you must mint your NFT — a procedure that adds your digital art to the Ethereum blockchain. There are two fees associated with minting for the first time under Rarible's pre-deployed Smart contracts:

1. A transaction to approve your wallet use via Rarible.
2. A minting transaction.

To begin minting, click on the Create button in the top right corner of the Rarible homepage.

Now, you can configure the details of your collectible:

1. Decide whether your NFT will be a single collection or multiple collection. Select **_Single_** if you’d like your collectible to be one of a kind or select your **_Multiple_** if you’d like to sell multiples of the same work.
2. Choose to make the artwork a RARI collection or an ERC-721 collection.
3. Write your very own title and description for the artwork.
4. Select what percentage of royalties a future buyer will receive.

Click **_Create item_** and your request will be processed and minted immediately.
