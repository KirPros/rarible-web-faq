So you saw an NFT you can’t resist anymore? Here’s how to make it yours: Click on the piece you want to own. The page will list some details: creator, description, owners, history.

- If the NFT is listed at a fixed price, click “Buy”, like in any online store. You can choose to pay with crypto (you will need some cryptocurrency for the right blockchain in your wallet) or with a credit card.
- To bid on a timed auction, click “Place a bid”, follow the instructions and hope you’re the winner! You currently can’t use a credit card to participate in the auctions.

If you don’t know what to buy, head over to the Explore section on the Rarible homepage and browse!

To get started, we recommend only buying from verified users, whom you can spot by the yellow checkmark. These are creators whose identity and authenticity we’ve verified.
