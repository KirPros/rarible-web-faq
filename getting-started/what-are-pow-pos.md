We’re almost done with the technical terms, just bear with us for a moment here! These two “consensus mechanisms” are different ways blockchains validate transactions. There are big technical differences, but we promised to spare you the technical talk—so let’s talk about what matters to you.

The main practical differences are:

- Proof of Work is extremely secure and decentralized, but consumes high amounts of energy and makes blockchains relatively slow because it relies on miners and their hardware to verify each block. In the case of Ethereum, it can also lead to high fees for buying, selling or minting NFTs.
- Proof of Stake blockchains usually have lower fees and higher performance since blocks are published by stakers—the PoS equivalent of miners—who lock up their funds in a smart contract. Because these blockchains are more efficient and no noisy expensive hardware is involved in the process, they also consume way less energy and have a smaller carbon footprint.

As far as how you interact with digital assets, nothing changes between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake blockchains.
