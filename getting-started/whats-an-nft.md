NFT stands for **_non-fungible token_**. Basically, NFTs are tokens that serve as proof of ownership for assets. At this point NFTs mostly represent digital art, but it can be anything from tweets and magazine articles to concept cars and real estate. Sky's the limit.

So what makes NFTs so good at representing ownership? NFTs live on the blockchain, meaning they're easy to track, and their authenticity can be easily verified at any time. When you say that you own a Basquiat painting, you have to make sure it’s been fully attributed if you want people to believe that it’s genuine - and even then, some will likely question that. However, when you hold a Crypto Punk in your crypto wallet, anyone can see it and check if it’s 100% legit in a matter of a few clicks.

NFTs are also _non-fungible_, meaning that one token cannot be replaced with another (unlike, say, a $5 dollar bill) due to their uniqueness. However, on Rarible.com we have NFTs that have multiple editions... okay, let’s not jump ahead.

### **_And what’s a blockchain?_**

A blockchain is a form of immutable public ledger which records any transaction that takes place on it. The main idea behind blockchains is to generate trust without the need for a trusted third party.

Ethereum has been considered to be the original blockchain for NFTs as it pioneered smart contracts (don’t worry, we’ll get into that later), but there are other blockchains that are great for NFTs, like Flow, Tezos, Polygon and Solana, among others.
