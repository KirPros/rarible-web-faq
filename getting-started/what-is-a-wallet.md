Your physical wallet probably contains your money, a form of ID, and maybe pictures of your loved ones (we’ll ignore that 3 year-old Starbuck’s membership card with $1.83 on it).

Your crypto wallet does that on a blockchain. It has an “ID” (a long string of numbers and letters), your cryptocurrencies and any NFTs you bought with those cryptocurrencies. And trust us, you’ll end up with something like that Starbuck’s gift card too.

There are a number of wallet providers, among them Metamask (the most popular and easy to use), Fortmatic, Coinbase and Rainbow—among others.

When you create a crypto wallet, you get a “seed phrase”—a series of words which let you recover your currencies or NFTs if you lose access.

**NEVER GIVE THIS PHRASE TO ANYONE.** Anyone who knows your seed phrase has full access to your wallet and can buy, sell or transfer any funds or assets. Neither Rarible support nor any trustworthy individual or organization will ever ask for your seed phrase.

To transact with cryptocurrencies or NFTs on Rarible or anywhere else, you need to connect your wallet to log in.

Some of the wallet connect options on Rarible include MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase, Fortmatic, Portis, and others.

## How do I choose the right wallet?

Wallets are free, so experiment to find the provider you like most. If you want, you can even import your wallet into another provider’s software with your seed phrase.

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is one of the most popular options for the Ethereum blockchain, existing as both a mobile app and a browser extension. [Fortmatic](https://fortmatic.com/) is one of the easiest wallets for newcomers, as it allows you to create one using your email address. [Rainbow Wallet](https://rainbow.me/) offers a great visual experience and browsing tools. [Coinbase](https://wallet.coinbase.com/) is a popular wallet that allows you to create a business account.
