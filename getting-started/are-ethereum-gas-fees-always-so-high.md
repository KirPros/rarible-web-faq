Ethereum gas fees vary according to supply and demand. But, like avoiding the highway during rush hour, you can mint, buy or sell when gas is lower. We’ve built a tool for you to see when you can get a better deal:

1. Go to [Rarible Analytics](https://raribleanalytics.com/).
2. Make sure the site is set to your timezone, which can be adjusted above the heatmap.
3. Select Average to explore current network costs. The speed options don’t matter much for beginners unless you need to mint, buy or sell in under a minute.

You can also use the heat map to determine the most cost effective time to trade.

Important: Always check the live gas tracker. The indication on the heatmap is not a guarantee gas fees are low duing that time.
