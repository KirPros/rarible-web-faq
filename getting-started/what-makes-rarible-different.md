Wait, Rarible is NOT the only marketplace out there? When did that happen? Ok, kidding. But here’s a few reasons you might love Rarible:

1. Mint for free! Other marketplaces force you to cover all minting fees — we have a free option.
2. Multi-chain: Some marketplaces only work on one blockchain. That means you miss out on NFTs you’d love which exist on other chains.
3. Pay with credit card—not everybody is comfortable with buying cryptocurrencies. Rarible lets you transact with your credit card like in any non-crypto online store.

We can go on about it all day, of course. See our [About](https://rarible.com/about) section for more context.
