While we could write endlessly on this topic, we’ll try to keep it brief:

Rarible is an easy-to-navigate NFT marketplace, but it's also so much more. No matter what type of NFT you want to create, collect, and/or sell, we harness blockchain technology to allow any user — expert or beginner — to easily create and mint their digital creations. We’ve also removed any barriers of entry without compromising your security. One example of fewer barriers is that Rarible works with multiple wallet providers.
